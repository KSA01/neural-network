Last assignment you were required to use a kNN to find the model for representing the data for the Iris and Abalone. 
Now do that again for this assignment but use a Neural Network. 
Follow the examples presented in class but make adjustments where appropriate to get better accuracy. 
I am not looking for a specific success rate but rather to see that you have developed a good NN for this problem that does well. 
You must still show the success rate on the test data. 
Give me all your code for loading the data, creating the model, and testing it in a zip file so I can try to reproduce everything. 
Make sure your code doesn't take longer than 10 minutes to train on Google Colab.
